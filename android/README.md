# Chromecast Example Android Sender

## Overview

Example Google Cast sender which sends commands to the receiver app.

## How to run

I recommend registering an example Google Cast receiver
and replace `chromecast_app_id` string resource with app id of registered receiver.
For registration, please follow steps
from [official Google Cast tutorial](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/registration?hl=en).
